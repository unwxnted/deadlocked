This repo is a fork of deadlocked by avitran0, with enhanced stealth features:

- **ftrace hook** instead of char device (no `/dev/i8042`, no `/sys/class/`)
- **Module hidden** from `/proc/modules` and `/sys/module/`
- **`PR_SET_DUMPABLE`** prevents VAC from inspecting the user-space process
- **No device node** — communication via ftrace-intercepted ioctl with magic commands
- **Syscall table intact** — no CR0 manipulation, no direct table modification

## Setup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone https://github.com/unwxnted/deadlocked
cd deadlocked
./setup.sh
# Restart your machine (required for uinput group)
```

Running NixOS or Fedora Atomic? See [OS-Specific Setup](os-setup.md).

## Running

```bash
./run.sh
```

On first run, `sudo` will ask for your password to load the kernel module (`iomem_rw.ko`). Subsequent runs won't need it (module persists until reboot).

### Anti-detection

| Measure | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| No `/dev` node | No `i8042` or suspicious device created |
| Module hidden | Removed from module list and sysfs |
| ftrace hook | Uses kernel's official ftrace API, no CR0 toggling |
| Process name | Masquerades as `gdbus` |
| Dumpable disabled | `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0` prevents VAC from reading process memory |
| String obfuscation | All sensitive paths encrypted with git hash key |

## FAQ

### Where are my configs saved?

Configs are saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with fallback to `$HOME/.config`. Otherwise they're saved alongside the executable.

### Which desktop environments and window managers are supported?

**Best support:**

- GNOME (Mutter)
- KDE (KWin)

**Good support:**

- SwayWM
- Weston

**Fair support:**

- i3
- OpenBox
- XFCE
- Hyprland (tweaks may be needed; no guarantees)

### I'm using Hyprland and something doesn't work

Hyprland has poor X11 support for the techniques this cheat uses, not much i can do about that.
Try another WM if possible.

### I'm using Gamescope and the overlay is too small

The game still thinks it's running in 16:9 resolution, so the cheat gets the wrong window resolution.
Try running the game without Gamescope.

### My screen/overlay is black

Your compositor or window manager doesn't support transparency, or it's not enabled.

On KDE, go into the `Display and Monitor` settings, then `Compositor`, and tick `Enable compositor on startup`.

### The overlay shows but I can't click anything

The window couldn't be made click-through. This is a window manager/compositor limitation.

### The overlay doesn't show up

Your window manager doesn't support positioning or resizing windows.

### The overlay isn't on top of other windows

Your window manager doesn't support always-on-top windows.
